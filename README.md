CUSTOMER SUPPORT EMAIL AGENTIC AI

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can autonomously plan, execute, and adapt to achieve goals in dynamic environments, unlike systems that simply react to input. These systems use sophisticated reasoning to make decisions, learn from feedback, and perform actions by interacting with tools and other systems. Think of it as AI that "does" instead of just "creates" content, often working collaboratively with humans.

Designing the Basic Chains
- Categorize Email : Identify the type of email(e.g., sales,custom inquiry,etc.)
- Research Router : Direct the email’s context to the appropriate search method.
- Search Keywords : Extract relevant keywords for gathering additional information.
- Write Draft Email : Use the research and email context to generate a thoughtful reply.
- Rewrite Router : Determine if the draft requires rewriting or further improvement.
- Draft Email Analysis : Evaluate the draft’s coherence, relevance, and tone.
- Rewrite Email : Finalize the email by refining its tone and content.
